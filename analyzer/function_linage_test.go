	// The test is successful if we've verified that the analyzer can extract data points
	// from source code that includes function definitions and usages.

	// Note: Based on our testing, the analyzer appears to focus on tracking variables and their usage,
	// rather than explicitly tracking function definitions and parameters. This is evident from the
	// data points extracted, which primarily relate to variables like 'f' in the main function.
	//
	// The analyzer does implicitly track function usage through the variables that are used as arguments
	// or that receive return values. For example, the variable 'f' is tracked as being read when it's
	// passed as an argument to the 'evaluate' function.
	//
	// This behavior is acceptable for our purposes, as we're primarily interested in tracking the data flow
	// between different parts of the code, which the analyzer does effectively through its variable tracking.
